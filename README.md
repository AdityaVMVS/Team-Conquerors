## Simulation_results
Please refer to the report folder for the problem statement and the scenerios that were simulated as part of this project. 
The results that were obtained from the simulation for the scenerios are listed below:
* Avg served blocks DL (vector) for Single cell with secondary GnB (results are available in cc_0_sc_dl.csv in CSV Files folder)
* Avg served blocks DL (vector) for  Multi cell with secondary GnB (results are available in mc_0_sc_dl.csv in CSV Files folder)
* Avg served blocks UL (vector) for Single cell with secondary GnB (results are available in sc_0_sc_ul.csv in CSV Files folder)
* Avg served blocks UL (vector) for Multi cell with secondary GnB  (results are available in mc_0_sc_ul.csv in CSV Files folder)

The results for the scenerios that were mentioned above can be found at "CSV folder" and corresponding results were converted into a CSV format.
